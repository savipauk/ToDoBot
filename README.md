# ToDoBot

A discord bot we are making in order to help us track progress on a planned project.
   
  
## Funtions:
##### /todo 
- Adds a task to the list
- example: ```/todo Finish this project```
##### /display
- Prints a list of all tasks and their authors
- example: ```/display```
##### /remove
- Removes the selected element from the list based on the id
- example: ```/remove 1```
