# ToDoBot

A discord bot we are making in order to help us track progress on a planned project.
   
  
## Funtions:
/todo - Adds a task to the list \
&emsp;example: /todo task    
/display - prints a list of all tasks and their authors\
&emsp;example: /display
/remove - removes the selected element from the list based on the id\
&emsp;example: /remove 1 (removes the element with the id of "1")
